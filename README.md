Topic Modeling on IMDB Movies Synopsis using LSI NLP

In this use case, we explore the hidden structures of 100 IMDB movies based on their synopsis content.

With exploding amount of digital data today, it is critical to have an efficient mechanism to manage, search and process them. Otherwise, we are just cluttering up our storage space. Natural language processing (NLP) is an excellent tool box to process the digital text data. Topic modeling are unsupervised learning approaches to obtain not only document similarity but also hidden structures in the texts.

Here, we apply topic modeling by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to a dataset of synopses of IMDB Top 100 Greatest Movies of All Time. LDA is result visualized by t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). We can observe 100 movies are successfully into 3 categories.
